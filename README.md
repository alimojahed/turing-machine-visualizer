# Turing Machine Visualizer
Welcome to the Turing Machine Visualizer project, developed as the final project for the Theory of Languages and Automata Course at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. This tool allows you to create and visualize Turing machines by defining the alphabet, tape alphabet, number of states, and transitions between states.

## Introduction
A Turing machine is a theoretical computational device that can simulate the logic of any computer algorithm. This project aims to provide a user-friendly way to interact with Turing machines by visualizing them. With this Turing Machine Visualizer, you can define your machine's characteristics, transitions, and see the entire machine definition.

## Usage
1. **Define Machine Characteristics**: Start by entering the alphabet, tape alphabet, and the number of states in the provided input fields.
2. **Define Transitions**:Define The Transition between each state.
   
3. **Visualize the Machine**
